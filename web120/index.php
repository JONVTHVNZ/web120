 <p>My name is Jonathan Zaragoza. Perhaps the first Mexican you'll ever meet that prefers the brood of the Pacific Northwest over the banal weather and scary oceans of Southern California. I am a lover by heart and fighter by nature, gentleman by day, philosopher by night, hooligan by choice rebel by fate.
        I continue to work with my heart and hands through illustration and design. A tenacious and ambitious problem solver and a firm believer in leaving things better than I found them. Before my death in the northwest I wish to color the world around me with my creativity and imagination.</p>
